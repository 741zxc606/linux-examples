This is binarytree/README.

This is a simple binary tree for Persistent Memory, implemented
on top of the libpmemalloc example.  All the example code is in:

	tree.c

The interfaces provided by this example are very simple -- you can
see the list of the in:

	tree.h

The other source files here are nothing but CLIs that gather arguments
and call functions in tree.c for testing.  Some examples of tests you
can run to play with the tree implementation:

	tree_insert testfile string_one string_two string_one string_three
	tree_walk testfile
	tree_free testfile

Like most examples, use -M to turn on the msync mode in libpmem, -F to turn
on the fault injection test mode in libpmem, and -d to enable debug output.

The command:

	make allcounts

will perform a fault injection test run (takes a while to run).
